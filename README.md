# Python Exercises

This repository contains my personal Python exercises and practice projects.  
The goal is to document my learning journey in programming and track my progress over time.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- Each folder contains one exercise with its own Python file.
- Some exercises also include a `README.md` file with details about the exercise.

## 📝 Exercises
- [Quarterly Average](./quarterly_average) → A simple program that calculates the average grade of 4 terms.

(… this list will grow as I add more exercises)
