# Quarterly Average

A simple Python program that calculates a student's quarterly average grade.

## How it works
- Input: the user enters 4 term grades (values from 0 to 10).  
- Validation: if a grade is greater than 10, the program asks again.  
- Output: the program calculates the average and prints the final result:
  - If the average is 7 or higher → "Congratulations, you passed!"
  - If the average is less than 7 → "You have to take the remedial exam!"
